# 🧠 Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Tutorial

A complete learning repository covering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** from **theory to practice** — created specially for students to master data understanding, cleaning, and visualization techniques in Python.

---

## 📘 Overview  

This repository serves as a **comprehensive guide** to learning EDA both conceptually and practically.  
It contains two main components:  

- 🧾 **Theory File:** Explains every EDA concept including data types, summary statistics, missing values, outliers, correlation, distributions, and visualization techniques.  
- 💻 **Practical Notebook:** A complete hands-on EDA project using the **Titanic dataset** (from Seaborn), demonstrating every concept step-by-step in Python.

This repository helps students connect **theory with real implementation**, making EDA easy and engaging to learn.

## 🔍 What You’ll Learn

✅ Understanding different types of data  
✅ Handling missing and duplicate values  
✅ Detecting and treating outliers  
✅ Exploring numerical and categorical features  
✅ Correlation analysis and feature relationships  
✅ Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
✅ Drawing meaningful insights and EDA summaries  

---

## 🧩 Dataset Used  

**Dataset:** Titanic (available in Seaborn library)  

```python
import seaborn as sns  
titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
````

The Titanic dataset is ideal for practicing EDA — it involves passenger survival data and helps learners explore relationships between features like age, gender, class, and survival status.
